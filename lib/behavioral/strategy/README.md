**What is it?**

The Strategy pattern is known as a behavioural pattern - it's used to manage algorithms, relationships and responsibilities between objects. 

The definition of Strategy provided in the original Gang of Four book on DesignPatterns states:

_Defines a set of encapsulated algorithms that can be swapped to carry out a specific behaviour_

**When Would I Use This Pattern?**

The Strategy pattern is to be used where you want to choose the algorithm to use at runtime. 

A good use of the Strategy pattern would be saving files in different formats, running various sorting algorithms, or file compression.

The Strategy pattern provides a way to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one as an object, and make them interchangeable.
